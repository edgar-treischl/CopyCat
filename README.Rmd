CopyCat is a simple package to handle code snippets in R. Save your code snippets as a data frame, CopyCat searches your data base and copies the code to the clipboard. Furthermore, it already includes some of my own code snippets and the `ggplot2` commands from the corresponding cheat sheet.

## Installation

Install CopyCat from my github account with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("edgar-treischl/CopyCat")
```

## Example

This is an example to show how CopyCat searches within a data frame for the code snippet you are looking for.

```{r example}
## load library and provide a data frame 
library(copycat)
head(CopyCatCode)
```

Let's say you cannot remember how `pivot_longer` from the `tidyr` package works. CopyCat comes with a example code, the copy cat code (`copycat::ccc`) which contains the described command base on minimal example; `copycat_code()` just returns the code snippet.

```{r}
## returns a code snippet
copycat_code("pivot_longer")
```

To work with your code snippets, `copy_that` saves the returned code to your clipboard.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# saves the returned code to the clipboad
copy_that("pivot_longer")
#> [1] "🐈 You are ready to paste!"
```

If the code is based on implemented data -- as all example in provided data -- you can see how it works just by pasting it into your console.

```{r}
relig_income %>% 
  pivot_longer(!religion, names_to = 'income', values_to = 'count')
```


Of course, this only works if you the corresponding package is already loaded. The `copycat_package()` function returns the name of package, just in case you cannot remember the name of the package anymore.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#search for a package name 
copycat_package("pivot_longer")
#>[1] "🐈 The package name is tidyr"
```

If you add typos, if you are not sure whether the function is written in small or large caps, you might be lucky and a similar match is found in the data.

```{r}
#typos and other mistakes 
copycat_package("bivot_longer")
```

Unfortunately, this will only work if a match is found at all.

```{r, eval=F}
copy_that("bivat")
#>[1] "💩 Sooorry, I've got no idea what you are looking for!"
```


I started to create this package because I search within my old files to often, especially for `ggplot` commands, which is why most commands from the `ggplot2` cheat sheet are already included in the data.

```{r}
CopyCatCode %>% 
  filter(package == "ggplot2") %>% 
  arrange(fct)
```

Feel free to use for your own data and code snippets from the past.
