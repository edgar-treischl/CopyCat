CopyCat is a small and personal package to copy, paste, and view code snippets. All provided code snippets are minimal examples based on code that runs with implemented data, which helps R learner to see how the code works. CopyCat uses three different code sources. First, CopyCat comes with a small data frame that includes code snippets from the cheat sheets of the `ggplot2` and the `tidyr` package. Of course, you can use your own code snippets as a data source as well. Second, CopyCat can fetch and copy code that lives on Github. Ultimately, CopyCat searches also within the R help files and vignettes for code that illustrates how a function works. Thus, CopyCat was built as a personal package for the lazy cats, but it will also help new R learner to manage code snippets. 



## Installation

Install CopyCat from my github account with:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("edgar-treischl/CopyCat",
                         build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

## Example snippets

I do not know how many times I have searched within my old scripts, especially for a `ggplot` command that I have been used many times, but I have forgotten the details. For this reason I started to create this package. CopyCat comes with a small data set (`CopyCatCode`) that contains minimal examples of several cheat sheets that run without further ado. For example, let's have a look at the minimal examples of the ggplot2 package. The `CopyCatCode` data provides the package name, the function, and the code of the minimal example:

```{r}
## load library and provide a data frame 
library(copycat)

CopyCatCode %>% 
  filter(package == "ggplot2") %>% 
  arrange(fct)
```


Let's say you cannot remember how `pivot_longer` from the `tidyr` package works. Just search for the corresponding code snippet via the `copycat()` function, it searches for the code snippet and saves the returned code to your clipboard. To see which code is returned, use the corresponding `copycat_code()` function.

```{r, eval=TRUE}
# copycat("pivot_longer") saves the returned code to the clipboad
#>[1] "🐈 Your code: relig_income %>% tidyr::pivot_longer(!religion, names_to = #>'income', values_to = 'count')"
# copycat_code() let us inspect what the function returned 
copycat_code("pivot_longer")

```

Since the code is based on implemented data -- as all examples listed in CopyCat -- you can see how it works just by pasting it into your console. Alternatively, set the `run` option to `TRUE` and `copycat()` sends the code to your console.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
copycat("pivot_longer", run = T )
```

```{r}
relig_income %>% 
  pivot_longer(!religion, names_to = 'income', values_to = 'count')
```



Of course, the minimal examples will only run if the package has been loaded and most of the time we know the package name. However, sometimes we have to look up the package name if we do not use a function often. The `copycat_package()` function returns the corresponding package name and sends the code `library(...)` directly to your console. The `copycat_package()` function copies the code also to the clipboard, since you want to insert it into your script as well.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#search for a package name, copies the load and loads the library
copycat_package("pivot_longer")
#>[1] [1] "🐈 Mission accomplished, loaded and copied library: tidyr"
```

If you add typos by accident, if you are not sure whether the function is written in small or large caps, you might be lucky and a similar match is found in the data.

```{r}
#typos and other mistakes 
copycat_package("bivot")
```

Unfortunately, this only works if a match is found at all.

```{r, eval=F}
copycat("bivatasa")
#>[1] "💩 Sooorry, I've got no idea what you are looking for!"
```

See the vignette for further examples how to use CopyCat for with github, help and other vignette files.
