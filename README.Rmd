CopyCat is a simple package to handle (your own) code snippets and it includes code snippets of the `ggplot2` and the `tidyr` package. It provides minimal examples from the cheat sheets that can be executed without further ado. Furthermore, you can also save your own code snippets as an additional data source, CopyCat searches within your data base and copies the code to the clipboard.

## Installation

Install CopyCat from my github account with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("edgar-treischl/CopyCat")
```

## Example

I started to create this package because I do not know how many times I searched within my old scripts, especially for some `ggplot` commands that I have been applied in the past, but I have forgotten the details. For this reason, CopyCat comes with a small data set (`CopyCatCode`) that contains minimal examples of several cheat sheets. For example, let's have a look at the minimal examples of the ggplot2 package. The `CopyCatCode` data provides the package name, the function, and the code of the minimal example:

```{r}
## load library and provide a data frame 
library(copycat)

CopyCatCode %>% 
  filter(package == "ggplot2") %>% 
  arrange(fct)
```


Let's say you cannot remember how `pivot_longer` from the `tidyr` package works. Just search for the corresponding code snippet via the `copy_that` function, it searches for the code snippet and saves the returned code to your clipboard.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# saves the returned code to the clipboad
copy_that("pivot_longer")
#> [1] "🐈 You are ready to paste!"
```

Since the code is based on implemented data -- as all examples listed in CopyCat -- you can see how it works just by pasting it into your console.

```{r}
relig_income %>% 
  pivot_longer(!religion, names_to = 'income', values_to = 'count')
```


Of course, the minimal examples will only run if the package has been loaded. The `copycat_package()` function returns the code to load the corresponding package and saves it into your clipboard, just in case you cannot remember the name of the package anymore.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#search for a package name 
copycat_package("pivot_longer")
#>[1] "🐈 The package name is tidyr"
```

If you add typos by accident, if you are not sure whether the function is written in small or large caps, you might be lucky and a similar match is found in the data.

```{r}
#typos and other mistakes 
copycat_package("bivot_longer")
```

Unfortunately, this only works if a match is found at all.

```{r, eval=F}
copy_that("bivat")
#>[1] "💩 Sooorry, I've got no idea what you are looking for!"
```

CopyCat can also be connected to your Github repository to copy the entire code of your old scripts. First, you have to setup the Github account details, that CopyCat will search for you.

```{r}
git_setup <- c(author = "edgar-treischl",
               repository = "Illustrations",
               branch = "master")
```

The `git_search()` function uses the Github API to search within your repository and returns all R scripts.


```{r}
git_search()
```

The `git_copy()` function copies your file to your clipboard.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
git_copy("boxplot_illustration")
#>[1] "🐈 Mission accomplished!"
```

CopyCat started as a personal package, but feel free to use it for your own data and code snippets. Just add your data frame with the same variable names and CopyCat handles your own snippets.
