CopyCat is a simple package to handle your own code snippets in R. Save your code snippets as a data frame, CopyCat searches your data base and copies the code to the clipboard. 

## Installation

Install CopyCat from my github account with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("edgar-treischl/CopyCat")
```

## Example

This is a basic example to show you how CopyCat searches within a data frame for the code snippet you are looking for. For illustration purposes, CopyCat comes with a tiny data set and some basic code snippets.

```{r example}
## load library and provide a data frame 
library(copycat)
df <- copycat::df
head(df)
```

Let's say you cannot remember how `pivot_longer` from the `tidyr` package works. A code snippet is saved in `copycat::df` and `copycat_code` just returns the code snippet.

```{r}
## returns a code snippet
copycat_code("pivot_longer", df)
```

To work with your code snippets, `copy_that` saves the code to your clipboard.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# saves the returned code to the clipboad
copy_that("pivot_longer", df)
#> [1] "You are ready to paste!"
```

If the code is based on implemented data -- as the example here -- you can see how it works by pasting it into your console.

```{r}
relig_income %>% 
  pivot_longer(!religion, names_to = 'income', values_to = 'count')
```

Ultimately, `copycat_package` returns the name of package in case you cannot remember the name of the package anymore.

```{r}
#search for a package name 
copycat_package("pivot_longer", df)
```
