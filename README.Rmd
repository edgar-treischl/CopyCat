CopyCat is a simple package to handle code snippets in R. Save your code snippets as a data frame, CopyCat searches your data base and copies the code to the clipboard. Furthermore, it already includes some of my own code snippets and the `ggplot2` commands from the corresponding cheat sheet.

## Installation

Install CopyCat from my github account with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("edgar-treischl/CopyCat")
```

## Example

This is a basic example to show you how CopyCat searches within a data frame for the code snippet you are looking for.

```{r example}
## load library and provide a data frame 
library(copycat)
head(ccc)
```

Let's say you cannot remember how `pivot_longer` from the `tidyr` package works. CopyCat comes with a example code, the copy cat code (`copycat::ccc`) which contains the described that; `copycat_code` just returns the code snippet.

```{r}
## returns a code snippet
copycat_code("pivot_longer", ccc)
```

To work with your code snippets, `copy_that` saves the code to your clipboard.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# saves the returned code to the clipboad
copy_that("pivot_longer", ccc)
#> [1] "You are ready to paste!"
```

If the code is based on implemented data -- as all example in ccc -- you can see how it works just by pasting it into your console.

```{r}
relig_income %>% 
  pivot_longer(!religion, names_to = 'income', values_to = 'count')
```


Of course, this only works if you loaded the corresponding package and `copycat_package` returns the name of package, just in case you cannot remember the name of the package anymore.

```{r}
#search for a package name 
copycat_package("pivot_longer", ccc)
```

I started to create this package because I started to search within my old files, especially for `ggplots`, which is why most commands from the cheat sheet are already included:

```{r}
ccc %>% 
  filter(package == "ggplot2") %>% 
  arrange(fct)
```
